# Weather-Dashboard

With this app, the user may enter just the city name, or "city, state" in the search box. The app will the weather map API and display the current weather conditions in that city, including temperature, humidity, UV index, and a picture representing whether it is clear, cloudy, raining, etc. Additionally, a 5-day forecast for that city is displayed below the current conditions showing similar information. Previous searches will be stored, and are also able to be cleared with the "Clear history" button.
